# Sequelized CRUD Burger App

- This is a sequelized version of the CRUD Burger App that I made in this [repository](https://github.com/yukanishijima/eat-da-burger).

- All the naitive MySQL queries have been replaced with Sequelize queries.

- A terminal command ```node run seed``` will populate the table with initial burger data instead of manually entering them into the database.
