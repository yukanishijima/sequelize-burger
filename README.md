## Functionality

- The app reads the database to get all the available burgers in the burger table in order to display them on the page. 

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. - This inserts a new burger to the database.

- When the user clicks the devour button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. - This updates a boolean value of the selected burger in the database.

- Once the delete button is clicked, then the burger will be deleted from the page as well as the database. 

- The app uses the MVC design model.
